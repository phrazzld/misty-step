# T012 Plan: Apply Theme to Identified Third-Party Components

## Task Description

Apply the new color scheme to third-party components identified in T011 using their specific theming methods.

## Analysis of Current State

After reviewing the documentation from T011 (`docs/third-party-components.md`), it is clear that no third-party components require separate theming. The analysis specifically found:

1. **Radix UI Components (Slot, Label)**: These are unstyled primitives that already inherit styling from our Tailwind CSS and CSS custom properties.
2. **Next.js Image Component**: This component has limited styling needs and is already adequately styled with Tailwind classes.
3. **class-variance-authority (CVA)**: This utility directly references our Tailwind CSS classes which use our CSS custom properties.

## Implementation Approach

Since T011 concluded that "no components require separate theming outside of our existing approach," this task is effectively completed without requiring any code changes. The current theming system using:

1. CSS custom properties defined in `globals.css`
2. Tailwind CSS mappings in `tailwind.config.mjs`
3. Consistent usage of semantic utility classes

...is sufficient for all components, including third-party ones.

## Verification Steps

Although no implementation is needed, I will verify the conclusion from T011 by:

1. Examining the component implementation files to confirm they're using the semantic color tokens.
2. Confirming that the styling approach is consistent with the documentation.

## Expected Results

- Documentation of verification results
- Task marked as completed with explanation that no separate theming is needed
- Unblocking dependent tasks (T013)
