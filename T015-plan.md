# T015 · Feature · P2: implement optional icon rendering

## Task Description

Implement icon rendering in the Services component based on the clarifications from C002. Use lucide-react icons for the service cards.

## Approach

1. Install lucide-react package
2. Create a separate module for service icon components
3. Update the Services component to render icons with the service cards
4. Ensure icons can be conditionally displayed and that the component handles missing icons gracefully

## Implementation Steps

1. Install lucide-react package (already done in T003)
2. Create lib/content/service-icons.tsx with icon components for each service
3. Import icon components in Services component
4. Create a mapping between service IDs and their corresponding icons
5. Update the card header in the Services component to display icons
6. Add conditional logic to handle missing icons gracefully
7. Run linting and type checking to ensure everything works correctly
