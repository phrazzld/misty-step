# T015 - Document core development tooling setup and workflow

## Task Description
- **ID and Title**: T015 · Chore · P2: Document core development tooling setup and workflow
- **Context**: Enable developers to understand and use the tooling
- **Action**:
  1. Update `README.md` or `CONTRIBUTING.md` with comprehensive instructions for setting up ESLint, Prettier, Husky (including `husky install`), and editor integration (e.g., format-on-save)
  2. Clearly describe the pre-commit workflow and how to troubleshoot common issues
- **Done-when**:
  1. Documentation is clear, accurate, comprehensive, and discoverable
  2. A new developer can follow the documentation to successfully set up their environment and understand the workflow
- **Verification**:
  1. Ask a team member unfamiliar with the setup to follow the documentation and provide feedback
- **Depends-on**: [T011]

## Analysis & Implementation Plan

### Current Status
After reviewing the existing project documentation:

1. The project already has extensive documentation in the README.md file, including:
   - Information about code quality tools (ESLint, Prettier, Husky, lint-staged)
   - Pre-commit hook workflow description
   - Configuration files overview
   - Recommended editor setup with VS Code extensions and settings
   - Continuous integration details

2. What's missing or could be improved:
   - Detailed setup instructions for a new developer (especially Husky setup)
   - Troubleshooting common issues with the tooling
   - Clear documentation on how to set up the development environment from scratch
   - Instructions for contributors on how to adhere to the project's code quality standards

### Implementation Strategy
Rather than duplicating information in the README.md, I'll create a dedicated CONTRIBUTING.md file in the docs directory focused specifically on development environment setup and workflow. This will:

1. Provide comprehensive setup instructions
2. Explain the tooling workflow in detail
3. Include troubleshooting guidance
4. Reference the README.md for general project information

### Document Outline
The new CONTRIBUTING.md will cover:

1. **Introduction** - Purpose of the document and relationship to other docs
2. **Prerequisites** - Required tools and versions
3. **Initial Setup** - Step-by-step environment setup including Husky installation
4. **Development Workflow** - Daily development process and tooling usage
5. **Pre-commit Workflow** - Detailed explanation of what happens during commits
6. **Editor Integration** - Setup for different editors (VS Code, JetBrains, etc.)
7. **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions
8. **Additional Resources** - Links to tool documentation

## Implementation Plan
1. Create a new `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` file with comprehensive documentation
2. Update README.md to reference the new CONTRIBUTING.md file
3. Ensure all information is accurate and aligned with current project setup
4. Verify the documentation covers all requirements in the task description
