# T021 · Chore · P3: update project `README.md`

## Task Description

Update the project README.md file to accurately reflect the service-centric structure of the marketing site.

## Approach

1. Review the current README.md content to understand what needs to be updated
2. Identify sections that describe site structure/features that need to be updated
3. Update those sections to reflect the service focus rather than features/solutions focus
4. Ensure any screenshots or diagrams are still accurate
5. Preserve any other important information unrelated to the site structure

## Implementation Steps

1. Read the current README.md
2. Make changes to reflect:
   - Removal of the Features component
   - Removal of the Solutions section
   - Addition of the Services component
   - Updated navigation structure (Services instead of Features/Solutions)
3. Check for any other references to "features" or "solutions" that should be updated
4. Update accordingly while preserving the document's overall structure and style
5. Commit the changes
