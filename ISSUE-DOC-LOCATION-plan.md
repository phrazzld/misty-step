# Clarification Issue: Determine canonical location for developer tooling documentation

## Issue Description
- **Issue:** Determine the canonical location for developer tooling documentation (e.g., `README.md` vs. `CONTRIBUTING.md` vs. a dedicated `docs/` folder)
- **Context:** Documentation tasks
- **Blocking?:** No

## Analysis & Implementation Plan

### Current Documentation Structure
After examining the current documentation structure:

1. The project currently uses a hybrid approach for documentation:
   - `README.md` in the project root: Contains general project overview, basic setup, structure, and high-level documentation on technology stack and code quality
   - `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`: Contains detailed setup instructions, workflow, and guidelines for contributors
   - `docs/CONTRIBUTING-STORYBOOK.md`: Contains specific guidelines for Storybook
   - `docs/DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md` and its appendices: Define core development principles and language-specific standards
   - `docs/GLANCE-COMMAND.md`: Documentation for the automated directory documentation tool

2. The documentation seems to be well-organized and follows a logical structure:
   - README provides the entry point and overview
   - More detailed/specific documentation lives in the docs/ folder

### Documentation Standards and Best Practices
Industry standards and best practices for documentation locations:

1. **README.md in project root**:
   - Purpose: Project introduction, high-level overview, quick start
   - Audience: All developers and project stakeholders
   - Best practices: Keep concise, link to more detailed docs

2. **CONTRIBUTING.md in project root or docs/**:
   - Purpose: Contribution workflow, setup, standards
   - Audience: New contributors
   - Best practices: Comprehensive but accessible

3. **docs/ folder**:
   - Purpose: Detailed documentation, specialized guides
   - Audience: Developers needing in-depth information
   - Best practices: Well-organized, cross-referenced

### Evaluation of Current Structure
The current structure mostly aligns with industry best practices:

- README.md serves as a good entry point with links to more detailed docs
- CONTRIBUTING.md contains appropriate content but is in docs/ rather than root
- docs/ folder contains specialized documentation
- Cross-references between documents exist but could be more consistent

### Proposed Documentation Structure
Based on this analysis, the recommended canonical locations are:

1. **Project Overview & Quick Start**: `README.md` (project root)
   - Keep existing information about project structure, technology stack
   - Include links to all other documentation
   - Focus on making it easy for new developers to get started

2. **Contribution Guidelines**: `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`
   - Current location is appropriate
   - Contains detailed setup instructions, workflow guidelines
   - Keep tool-specific documentation here (ESLint, Prettier, etc.)

3. **Specialized Documentation**: `docs/` folder
   - Keep DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md and its appendices here
   - Keep tool-specific guides like CONTRIBUTING-STORYBOOK.md here
   - Maintain clear cross-references between documents

### Implementation Strategy
Since the current documentation structure already largely follows best practices, this is primarily a documentation task to clarify and formalize the existing approach. I'll:

1. Document the canonical locations and purposes for each type of documentation
2. Update existing cross-references between documents for consistency
3. Mark the issue as addressed in the TODO.md file

### Expected Changes
- Update the README.md to include a "Documentation" section that clearly explains the documentation structure
- Add a brief note to docs/CONTRIBUTING.md explaining the documentation structure
