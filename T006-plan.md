# T006 Plan: Implement Light Mode Colors in globals.css

## Task Classification

This is a **Simple** task that involves updating a single file with predetermined values. It requires accurate implementation of the finalized color values into the `:root` section of `app/globals.css`.

## Approach

1. Examine the current `app/globals.css` to understand the structure
2. Extract the finalized light mode color values from `docs/colors.md`
3. Update the `:root` section in `globals.css` with the new values
4. Ensure all semantic color tokens are included and have the correct values
5. Verify that the variable names match Shadcn UI expectations

## Implementation Details

1. Replace all color values in the `:root` scope (lines 45-78) of `app/globals.css` with the corresponding values from the "Light Mode Colors" section of `docs/colors.md`
2. Ensure the format is consistent with the existing file (e.g., maintaining the current structure)
3. Do not modify the theme configuration at the top of the file or any other sections
4. All 33 color tokens must be updated, including:
   - Base colors (background, foreground, primary, etc.)
   - UI component colors (border, input, card, etc.)
   - Sidebar navigation colors
   - Data visualization colors (chart-1 through chart-5)

## Testing Strategy

1. No unit tests are required for this change as it's a straightforward CSS update
2. The changes will be validated by linting and formatting checks

## Risks and Mitigations

- Risk: Missing a color token that's needed by the UI
  - Mitigation: Cross-reference the complete list of tokens in the documentation with what's currently in the file
- Risk: Introducing formatting inconsistencies
  - Mitigation: Run formatters after implementation
