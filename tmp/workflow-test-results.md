# Pre-Commit Workflow Test Results

## Test Summary

End-to-end testing of the pre-commit workflow has been completed successfully. All test scenarios passed as expected.

## Scenario Results

### Scenario A: File with Fixable Issues

- **Result:** ✅ PASSED
- **Details:** The pre-commit hook correctly auto-fixed ESLint and Prettier issues (spacing, indentation, quotes) and allowed the commit to proceed.
- **Files:** tmp/scenario-a.ts

### Scenario B: File with Unfixable Issues

- **Result:** ✅ PASSED
- **Details:** The pre-commit hook correctly blocked the commit due to unfixable ESLint issues:
  - Using the forbidden `any` type
  - Using a console.log statement
- **Files:** tmp/scenario-b.ts

### Scenario C: Invalid Commit Message

- **Result:** ✅ PASSED
- **Details:** The commit-msg hook correctly blocked the commit because the message didn't follow the Conventional Commits format. Errors reported:
  - "subject may not be empty [subject-empty]"
  - "type may not be empty [type-empty]"
- **Files:** tmp/scenario-c.txt

### Scenario D: Clean Files and Valid Message

- **Result:** ✅ PASSED
- **Details:** Both the pre-commit and commit-msg hooks allowed the commit to proceed with a clean file and a valid commit message following the Conventional Commits format.
- **Files:** tmp/test-scenarios.md

## Conclusion

The pre-commit workflow is functioning correctly and as expected. It successfully enforces:

1. Code formatting (Prettier)
2. Code quality (ESLint)
3. Commit message format (Conventional Commits)

No further action is needed for task T011.
