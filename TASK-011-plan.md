# TASK-011: Code Review and QA Sign-off

## Plan

1. Verify all previous tasks are completed:

   - Check the status of TASK-001 through TASK-010 in TODO.md
   - Ensure all are marked as [x] (completed)

2. Perform final QA checks:
   - Verify Storybook configuration is correct (.storybook directory)
   - Test Storybook development server (pnpm storybook)
   - Test Storybook static build (pnpm build-storybook)
   - Review README documentation for accuracy
3. Prepare for PR:
   - Check current branch and determine target branch
   - Create PR description summarizing all completed tasks and changes
   - List key files modified and added
4. Submit PR:
   - If GitHub CLI is available, use `gh pr create`
   - If not available, provide instructions for creating PR via GitHub web interface

## Implementation Approach

- We'll focus on verifying the work done rather than making significant new changes
- Key areas to verify:
  - Storybook configuration files (.storybook/main.ts, .storybook/preview.ts)
  - Updated CI workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml)
  - README documentation
  - Test story (stories/SetupVerification.stories.tsx)
  - Package dependencies (package.json)
  - PostCSS configuration (postcss.config.mjs)
  - Tailwind configuration (tailwind.config.mjs)
