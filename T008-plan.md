# T008 Plan: Add Explanatory Comments to globals.css

## Task Description

Add inline comments to `app/globals.css` explaining the semantic role of each CSS color variable.

## Task Classification

**Simple** - This task involves adding documentation comments to a single file without changing functionality.

## Implementation Approach

1. Add category headers to group related variables
2. Add inline comments for each CSS color variable explaining its purpose and usage
3. Use consistent comment style and vocabulary
4. Reference the semantic roles from docs/colors.md

## Implementation Steps

1. Identify logical groupings for the color variables (base colors, component colors, etc.)
2. Add section comments to separate these groupings
3. For each variable, add a comment describing:
   - Its semantic purpose
   - Where it's typically used
   - Any relationships to other variables
4. Ensure comments are consistent in style and detail level
5. Review to ensure all color variables have appropriate documentation

## Notes

- Comments should be clear and concise
- Group variables by their functional categories
- Use consistent terminology throughout
- Focus on explaining the semantic purpose, not the color value itself
