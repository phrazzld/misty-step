# Implementation Plan: Configure Core Development Tooling (Linting, Formatting, Pre-commit Hooks)

## Overview

This plan outlines the implementation of core development tooling for the marketing-site project. It focuses on ensuring consistent code quality, enforcing standards, and automating repetitive tasks through proper configuration of linting (ESLint), formatting (Prettier), and pre-commit hooks (Husky + lint-staged).

## Objectives

1. Verify and enhance ESLint configuration for enforcing code consistency and best practices
2. Verify and enhance Prettier configuration for consistent code formatting
3. Configure Husky and lint-staged for automated pre-commit checks
4. Ensure all tools work together without conflicts
5. Verify CI integration for enforcing the same standards in the build pipeline

## Current Status

The project already has:

- ESLint configured with a comprehensive configuration (eslint.config.mjs)
- Prettier configured (.prettierrc.js)
- Basic Husky setup with commit-msg, pre-commit, and post-commit hooks
- lint-staged configuration (.lintstagedrc.json)

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Verify and Enhance ESLint Configuration

The current ESLint configuration is comprehensive but should be verified for:

- Proper rule coverage according to the Development Philosophy and TypeScript/Frontend appendices
- Integration with CI pipeline for consistent enforcement
- Performance and maintainability for developers

#### Tasks:

1. Review existing ESLint configuration for completeness
2. Test ESLint on the codebase to ensure proper rule coverage
3. Fix any linting violations in the codebase

### 2. Verify and Enhance Prettier Configuration

The existing Prettier configuration looks solid but should be validated against project needs.

#### Tasks:

1. Verify Prettier configuration against the Development Philosophy requirements
2. Ensure editor integration is documented for consistent development experience
3. Test Prettier formatting across different file types

### 3. Configure and Enhance Husky and lint-staged

While basic Husky hooks exist, they should be improved for a complete pre-commit workflow.

#### Tasks:

1. Update the pre-commit hook to run lint-staged properly
2. Verify the commit-msg hook for enforcing Conventional Commits
3. Consider adding additional hooks for comprehensive quality checks
4. Ensure lint-staged configuration covers all relevant file types

### 4. Integration of Tools

Ensure all tools work together without conflicts, especially ESLint and Prettier.

#### Tasks:

1. Verify ESLint and Prettier integration to avoid conflicts
2. Test the complete pre-commit workflow with real changes
3. Document the tooling setup for developers

### 5. CI Integration

Ensure CI pipeline enforces the same standards as local development.

#### Tasks:

1. Verify GitHub Actions or other CI configurations for linting and formatting checks
2. Ensure CI fails on linting and formatting violations
3. Align CI checks with pre-commit hooks for consistency

## Technical Decisions

### Linting Strategy

- Continue using ESLint with the flat config format (eslint.config.mjs)
- Maintain strict TypeScript rules with no exceptions for 'any' type
- Enforce component best practices and accessibility standards

### Formatting Strategy

- Use Prettier as the sole source of truth for code formatting
- Configure editors to format on save for the best developer experience
- Run formatting checks in CI to ensure consistency

### Pre-commit Workflow

- Use Husky for Git hook management
- Use lint-staged to run checks only on staged files for performance
- Configure commit message validation with commitlint

## Testing Plan

1. Manually test the entire pre-commit workflow with real code changes
2. Verify that linting catches common issues in test files
3. Ensure formatting produces consistent results across the codebase
4. Test commit message validation with various correct and incorrect formats

## Rollout Plan

1. Implement and test all changes locally
2. Document the setup and workflow for developers
3. Create a PR with the changes
4. Ensure CI passes with the updated configuration
5. Merge the changes into the main branch

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

| Risk                                         | Severity | Mitigation                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Developer resistance to strict linting rules | Medium   | Document the rationale for rules, provide automated fixes where possible   |
| Performance impact of pre-commit hooks       | Medium   | Optimize lint-staged configuration to only run on changed files            |
| Conflicts between ESLint and Prettier        | Low      | Use eslint-config-prettier to disable conflicting rules                    |
| CI failures due to inconsistent environments | Low      | Document exact versions of tools to use, configure in package.json engines |

## Future Considerations

1. Add static analysis tools beyond ESLint (e.g., SonarQube, CodeQL)
2. Implement automated dependency updates with Dependabot
3. Consider Git hooks for additional quality checks (e.g., bundle size analysis)
4. Add pre-push hooks for comprehensive testing

## Success Criteria

1. Developers can commit code with automatic formatting and linting
2. CI pipeline enforces the same standards as local development
3. Commit messages follow the Conventional Commits specification
4. Documentation is clear for new team members
5. No need for manual checks during code review for formatting and basic linting issues
