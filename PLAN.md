## Detailed Remedies

### cr-01 Fix Non-Portable Symlink for Documentation

- **Problem:** Documentation file `docs/DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY_APPENDIX_FRONTEND.md` is an inaccessible absolute-path symlink.
- **Impact:** Blocks documentation access for team and CI/CD, violating portability.
- **Chosen Fix:** Replace the symlink with the actual file content directly in the repository.
- **Steps:**
  1.  Identify the source content of the symlink (`/Users/phaedrus/...`).
  2.  Delete the symlink `docs/DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY_APPENDIX_FRONTEND.md` from the repository (`git rm ...`).
  3.  Create a new file at the same path containing the actual documentation content.
  4.  Commit the new file (`git add ...`).
- **Done-When:** The file exists as a regular file in Git, is readable by all, and CI passes doc checks.

### cr-03 Remove Story Exclusion from Test Coverage

- **Problem:** Story files (`*.stories.tsx`) are excluded from Vitest coverage analysis.
- **Impact:** Hides untested logic within stories (e.g., `play` functions), undermining quality gates.
- **Chosen Fix:** Remove the story file exclusion pattern from the Vitest configuration.
- **Steps:**
  1.  Edit `vitest.config.ts`.
  2.  Remove the `"**/*.stories.{ts,tsx}"` pattern from the `coverage.exclude` array.
  3.  Commit the change.
  4.  Run coverage and verify stories are included in the report.
- **Done-When:** `coverage.exclude` no longer lists story files; coverage report includes story logic.

### cr-13 Formalize and Enforce PNPM Usage

- **Problem:** Mandated `pnpm` usage is hidden in an obscure file (`CLAUDE.md`).
- **Impact:** New contributors miss the requirement, leading to inconsistent environments.
- **Chosen Fix:** Document the requirement prominently and enforce it technically via `package.json`.
- **Steps:**
  1.  Add a clear statement mandating `pnpm` usage to the Setup section of `README.md` and/or `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
  2.  Add `"packageManager": "pnpm@<version>"` to `package.json` (use the correct project version).
  3.  (Optional) Add `.npmrc` with `engine-strict=true`.
  4.  Delete `CLAUDE.md` (or integrate any other useful content elsewhere).
- **Done-When:** `pnpm` requirement is documented in main README/CONTRIBUTING and enforced via `package.json`.

### cr-14 Link to Orphaned Storybook Contribution Guidelines

- **Problem:** `docs/CONTRIBUTING-STORYBOOK.md` exists but is not linked from main documentation.
- **Impact:** Developers are unaware of specific Storybook contribution standards.
- **Chosen Fix:** Add links to the guidelines from `README.md` and/or `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- **Steps:**
  1.  Edit `README.md` and add a link to `docs/CONTRIBUTING-STORYBOOK.md` in the Contribution/Development section.
  2.  Edit `CONTRIBUTING.md` (if exists) and add a link similarly.
- **Done-When:** Clear links to `docs/CONTRIBUTING-STORYBOOK.md` exist in primary contribution documentation.

### cr-15 Remove Unjustified Global Story Margin Decorator

- **Problem:** A global Storybook decorator adds `margin: "1rem"` to all stories without justification.
- **Impact:** May interfere with component layout, visual testing, or intended component boundaries.
- **Chosen Fix:** Remove the global margin decorator.
- **Steps:**
  1.  Edit `.storybook/preview.tsx`.
  2.  Remove the decorator applying the `margin: "1rem"` style wrapper.
  3.  Visually verify stories in Storybook; apply spacing locally within stories only if needed for specific demos.
- **Done-When:** The global margin decorator is removed from `.storybook/preview.tsx`.

### cr-18 Ensure Husky Hook Echo Command Ends with Newline

- **Problem:** The `echo` command in `.husky/post-commit` lacks a final newline.
- **Impact:** Causes minor terminal formatting issues where the prompt follows immediately.
- **Chosen Fix:** Ensure the `echo` command output includes a trailing newline.
- **Steps:**
  1.  Edit `.husky/post-commit`.
  2.  Verify the `echo` command on line 9 does not use `-n` and naturally outputs a newline.
  3.  Ensure the file itself ends with a newline character.
- **Done-When:** Terminal output from the hook is correctly formatted with a trailing newline.

### cr-05 Restore Deleted Historical Planning Documentation

- **Problem:** Historical planning documents (`PLAN-*.md`) were deleted.
- **Impact:** Loss of critical project context, rationale, and decision history.
- **Chosen Fix:** Restore files from Git history and archive them within the `docs` directory.
- **Steps:**
  1.  Use `git checkout <commit-hash>^ -- <path/to/PLAN-*.md>` to restore the deleted files (`PLAN-2.md`, `PLAN-INDEX.md`, `PLAN-ORIGINAL.md`).
  2.  Create directory `docs/archive/planning/`.
  3.  Move the restored files into `docs/archive/planning/` (`git mv ...`).
  4.  Commit the restored and moved files.
  5.  Add a reference to this archive directory in `README.md` or `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- **Done-When:** Historical planning documents are present in `docs/archive/planning/` and referenced.

### cr-02 Decouple Storybook from Next.js `next/image`

- **Problem:** Storybook stories directly import and use `next/image`.
- **Impact:** Violates component isolation, couples Storybook to Next.js, risks errors outside Next.js context.
- **Chosen Fix:** Replace `next/image` with standard HTML `<img>` tags and configure static asset serving.
- **Steps:**
  1.  Verify `.storybook/main.ts` includes `staticDirs: ['../public']` (or equivalent).
  2.  In `components/ui/button.stories.tsx` (lines 3, 98, 113):
      - Remove the `next/image` import.
      - Replace `<Image ... />` with `<img ... />`.
      - Ensure `src` paths are relative to `public` (e.g., `/icons/lucide-icon.svg`).
  3.  Test affected stories in Storybook to ensure images load correctly.
- **Done-When:** No `next/image` usage in stories; images render correctly via `<img>`.

### cr-08 Clarify Tailwind Directive Handling in Storybook

- **Problem:** Omitting `@tailwind` directives in `.storybook/preview.css` relies implicitly on `globals.css` import.
- **Impact:** Makes Tailwind integration less explicit and potentially fragile.
- **Chosen Fix:** Add a prominent comment in `preview.css` explaining the reliance on `globals.css` import.
- **Steps:**
  1.  Edit `.storybook/preview.css`.
  2.  Add a comment at the top explaining why `@tailwind` directives are omitted and confirming that importing `globals.css` in `preview.tsx` is the intended mechanism.
  3.  Visually verify styles in Storybook match the application.
- **Done-When:** A clarifying comment exists in `.storybook/preview.css`; styles are verified.

### cr-09 Document `CardAction` Subcomponent API

- **Problem:** The `CardAction` subcomponent lacks TSDoc comments.
- **Impact:** Creates an undocumented internal API surface, increasing friction.
- **Chosen Fix:** Add comprehensive TSDoc comments to the `CardAction` component definition.
- **Steps:**
  1.  Edit `components/ui/card.tsx`.
  2.  Add TSDoc comments above the `CardAction` definition (lines 61-72), explaining its purpose (e.g., container for actions in `CardHeader`), props, and usage context.
  3.  Verify Storybook's auto-generated docs pick up the comments.
- **Done-When:** `CardAction` component has clear TSDoc documentation.

### cr-16 Use Idiomatic React Import Style

- **Problem:** Non-idiomatic `import * as React from "react";` is used.
- **Impact:** Verbose and generally unnecessary with modern JSX transforms.
- **Chosen Fix:** Remove unnecessary imports or switch to standard `import React from "react";` / named imports.
- **Steps:**
  1.  Identify files using `import * as React` (e.g., `button.stories.tsx:3`, `textarea.stories.tsx:3`, `.storybook/preview.tsx:3`).
  2.  If only JSX is used, remove the import.
  3.  If React APIs (hooks, context) are used, change to `import React from "react";` or specific named imports (`import { useState } from "react";`).
- **Done-When:** React imports follow standard, idiomatic patterns.

### cr-06 Enforce Consistent Use of Library Components in Stories

- **Problem:** Stories bypass `Button`/`Label` components, using raw HTML and manual styling.
- **Impact:** Undermines library purpose, duplicates logic, risks inconsistency, masks component deficiencies.
- **Chosen Fix:** Refactor `Label` to handle `required` prop; replace all raw HTML in stories with library components.
- **Steps:**
  1.  Edit `components/ui/label.tsx`: ensure it accepts a `required?: boolean` prop and renders the required indicator internally based on it.
  2.  Audit stories (`card.stories.tsx:101`, `input.stories.tsx:73-77`, `label.stories.tsx`, `textarea.stories.tsx`) for raw `<button>`, `<label>`, and manual required indicator `<span>` elements.
  3.  Replace _all_ instances with the project's `Button` and `Label` components, utilizing the `required` prop on `Label`.
  4.  Rigorously verify visual consistency in Storybook.
- **Done-When:** No raw HTML elements for library-defined components exist in stories; `Label` handles `required` state internally.

### cr-04 Replace Fragile CSS State Simulation with Interaction Tests

- **Problem:** Interactive states are faked via custom CSS classes and wrappers.
- **Impact:** Brittle, complex, inaccurate visual representation, diverges from actual component styling.
- **Chosen Fix:** Eliminate CSS/wrappers; use Storybook's `play` function with `userEvent` for interaction testing.
- **Steps:**
  1.  Delete `components/ui/button-states.css`, `input-states.css`, `textarea-states.css`.
  2.  Remove the `InteractiveState*` wrapper components and their usage from stories.
  3.  Refactor affected stories to use the `play` function (`@storybook/addon-interactions`) with `userEvent` to programmatically trigger `:hover`, `:focus`, `:active` states.
  4.  Document that visual state verification relies on interaction tests or investigate pseudo-state addon integration.
- **Done-When:** No simulation CSS/wrappers remain; interactive states are tested via `play` functions.

### cr-12 Refactor Inconsistent Story Structure (`args` vs. `render`)

- **Problem:** Stories inconsistently use `render` for simple prop variations where `args` would suffice.
- **Impact:** Increases boilerplate and cognitive load, contradicts guidelines.
- **Chosen Fix:** Refactor simple stories to use the `args` property consistently.
- **Steps:**
  1.  Audit stories noted (`input.stories.tsx:64`, `label.stories.tsx`, `textarea.stories.tsx`).
  2.  Convert stories using `render` solely to set basic props on a single component instance to use the `args` property instead.
  3.  Reserve `render` for complex compositions or stateful logic.
- **Done-When:** Simple prop variations in stories consistently use the `args` property.

### cr-17 Improve Generic Story Names for Clarity

- **Problem:** Story names like "Default", "Basic", "WithLabel" are uninformative.
- **Impact:** Slightly hinders navigation and understanding within Storybook.
- **Chosen Fix:** Rename stories to be more descriptive of the state or variant shown.
- **Steps:**
  1.  Review story names in `*.stories.tsx` files.
  2.  Rename generic names to be specific (e.g., `Default` -> `Primary`, `WithLabel` -> `InputWithAssociatedLabel`).
- **Done-When:** Story names clearly describe the component state or scenario being demonstrated.

### cr-07 Audit and Remediate Risky Post-Commit Hook

- **Problem:** The post-commit hook runs an undocumented async command, logs insecurely to `/tmp/`, and lacks feedback.
- **Impact:** Opaque, potentially insecure, and unreliable automation.
- **Chosen Fix:** Audit necessity, document purpose, secure logging, provide feedback, and update format.
- **Steps:**
  1.  **Audit & Document:** Determine if the `glance` command is necessary. Document purpose, output, failure modes in `README.md` or `docs/`.
  2.  **Logging:** Change output redirection to `.logs/husky/glance-post-commit.log` (ensure `.logs` is gitignored). Set appropriate file permissions (`chmod 600`).
  3.  **Feedback:** Ensure hook provides clearer feedback on success/failure, or consider synchronous execution if failure should block (e.g., pre-push).
  4.  **Necessity/Format:** Evaluate if it belongs in commit hook vs CI. Address Husky v10 format update.
- **Done-When:** Hook is documented, logs securely, provides feedback, and its necessity/placement is confirmed.

### cr-10 Enhance Component Prop Documentation (`argTypes`)

- **Problem:** `argTypes` definitions omit many standard HTML attributes and relevant ARIA attributes.
- **Impact:** Reduces Storybook's value as interactive documentation and API reference.
- **Chosen Fix:** Systematically enhance `argTypes` for core UI components.
- **Steps:**
  1.  Audit `Button`, `Card`, `Input`, `Label`, `Textarea` components.
  2.  Enhance `meta.argTypes` in corresponding `.stories.tsx` files to include relevant pass-through HTML attributes (`id`, `className`, event handlers, form attributes) and ARIA attributes (`aria-label`, `aria-invalid`).
  3.  Provide brief descriptions and appropriate controls (`text`, `boolean`, `control: false`).
- **Done-When:** Core UI components have comprehensive `argTypes` covering common HTML/ARIA attributes.

### cr-11 Add Missing State and Edge Case Coverage in Stories

- **Problem:** Stories lack coverage for true interactive states and common edge cases.
- **Impact:** Limits Storybook's utility for robust visual testing, accessibility validation, and resilience demonstration.
- **Chosen Fix:** Augment stories with edge-case data and implement interaction tests for states.
- **Steps:**
  1.  Add specific stories for `Button`, `Input`, `Textarea`, `Card`, `Label` demonstrating behavior with edge cases (long strings, empty content, wrapping text).
  2.  Implement interaction tests using the `play` function (building on cr-04 fix) to cover `:hover`, `:focus`, `:active` states programmatically.
- **Done-When:** Stories include explicit examples and tests for common edge cases and interactive states.

## Standards Alignment
