# Implementation Plan: Enforce Conventional Commits via Git Hooks (commitlint)

## Overview

This plan outlines the steps to enforce Conventional Commits via Git Hooks (commitlint) for the Misty Step marketing site. The goal is to ensure consistent commit message format, which enables automated changelog generation and semantic versioning, aligning with the Core Philosophy of the project.

## Current Status

- The project already has commitlint installed with basic configuration
- Husky is installed and configured with a commit-msg hook that runs commitlint
- A test file (test-commit-msg.txt) confirms the hook is working correctly

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Verify Current Configuration

- Review the current commitlint configuration in `commitlint.config.js`
- Verify the Husky commit-msg hook is correctly set up
- Check if any additional custom rules are needed beyond the standard configuration

### 2. Update Commitlint Configuration

- Enhance the commitlint configuration as needed to align with the project's requirements
- Configure any custom rules or conventions specific to the Misty Step project
- Ensure the configuration enforces:
  - Proper commit types (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore, etc.)
  - Optional scopes for specifying the area of changes
  - Clear and concise commit messages
  - Proper formatting for breaking changes

### 3. Update Documentation

- Create or update documentation to clearly explain:
  - The Conventional Commits format required for the project
  - Examples of valid commit messages
  - How to write good commit messages
  - How to handle breaking changes
  - The importance of following the standards
- Add this documentation to an appropriate location (e.g., CONTRIBUTING.md or docs/)

### 4. Configure CI Validation

- Set up a CI check to validate commit message format for PR titles/squashed commits
- Configure the CI workflow to fail if commit messages don't meet the standards
- Provide clear feedback for users when validation fails

### 5. Remove Test Verification File

- Remove the `test-commit-msg.txt` file that was used for verification
- This is noted in the backlog as a separate task but can be included in this implementation

### 6. Test the Implementation

- Test the commit-msg hook with various valid and invalid commit messages
- Verify that valid messages are accepted and invalid ones are rejected
- Ensure clear error messages are shown when validation fails
- Test the CI integration to ensure it correctly validates commit messages

### 7. Documentation for Developers

- Create guidelines for developers about:
  - How to format commit messages properly
  - Common issues and how to resolve them
  - How to amend commit messages if needed
  - Understanding error messages from commitlint

## Deliverables

1. Updated commitlint configuration
2. Documentation on Conventional Commits standards
3. CI integration for validating commit message format
4. Removal of test-commit-msg.txt file
5. Testing results confirming the implementation works correctly

## Success Criteria

- All commits follow the Conventional Commits format
- Invalid commit messages are rejected by the commit-msg hook
- CI checks validate PR titles and squashed commit messages
- Clear documentation is available for developers
- The test-commit-msg.txt file is removed from the repository
