# Task Description

## Overview

Enforce Conventional Commits via Git Hooks (commitlint) to ensure consistent commit history, enabling automated changelog generation and semantic versioning, aligning with Core Philosophy (Semantic Versioning).

## Requirements

- Integrate `commitlint` with Husky `commit-msg` hook to validate commit messages against Conventional Commits standards
- Configure CI check to validate commit message format of PR titles/squashed commits
- Ensure proper configuration for Conventional Commits validation
- Document the setup and standards for developers

## Technical Context

- The project already has commitlint installed with `@commitlint/config-conventional` extension
- Husky is already configured with a basic commit-msg hook that runs commitlint
- The project follows semantic versioning principles as outlined in Development Philosophy
- There's a test-commit-msg.txt file that verifies the hook is working, which needs to be removed

## Considerations

- The commitlint configuration should align with Development Philosophy's strict guidelines
- Documentation should be clear on commit message format requirements
- CI integration should be reliable and provide clear feedback
- Consider automated tools for changelog generation based on commit messages
- Any necessary customizations for Misty Step's specific needs in the commit messages
