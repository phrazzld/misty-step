# T013 Findings: CI Pipeline Behavior Test

## Overview

This document summarizes the expected and observed behaviors of the GitHub Actions CI workflow for code quality checks.

## Test Files Created

### 1. `test-ci-errors.ts`

- **Purpose**: To verify that the CI workflow correctly identifies and reports code quality issues
- **Issues Included**:
  - Formatting errors (extra spaces, inconsistent spacing)
  - Linting errors (unused variables, missing semicolons)
  - Type errors (`any` type used)
- **Expected CI Behavior**: The code quality workflow should fail with error messages identifying:
  - Formatting issues (from `pnpm format:check`)
  - Linting issues (from `pnpm lint`)
  - Type errors (from `pnpm typecheck`)

### 2. `test-ci-clean.ts`

- **Purpose**: To verify that the CI workflow passes with clean code
- **Features**:
  - Proper formatting
  - No linting issues
  - Proper type annotations
  - JSDoc comments
- **Expected CI Behavior**: The code quality workflow should pass all checks

## Validation Approach

Since we're testing on the feature branch rather than creating separate test PRs:

1. We can observe the expected behavior by running the same commands locally that the CI workflow would run:

   - `pnpm format:check`
   - `pnpm lint`
   - `pnpm typecheck`

2. Real-world validation would occur when this branch is pushed and a PR is created:
   - The actual CI workflow would run on GitHub
   - Results would be visible in the GitHub PR interface

## Local Validation Results

### Test 1: Running checks against `test-ci-errors.ts`

The following issues were reported:

#### Formatting (prettier)

- Formatting issues were detected in `test-ci-errors.ts`
- Command `pnpm format:check` failed with error code 1

#### Linting (eslint)

The following errors were reported for `test-ci-errors.ts`:

```
/Users/phaedrus/Development/misty-step/marketing-site/test-ci-errors.ts
 3:10  error  'testCIFailure' is defined but never used. Allowed unused vars must match /^_/u            @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars
 3:30  error  Unexpected any. Specify a different type                                                   @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any
 3:35  error  'unusedParam' is defined but never used. Allowed unused args must match /^_/u              @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars
 5:11  error  'unusedVariable' is assigned a value but never used. Allowed unused vars must match /^_/u  @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars
 8:11  error  'anotherUnused' is assigned a value but never used. Allowed unused vars must match /^_/u   @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars
14:9   error  Unexpected console statement                                                               no-console
```

#### Type Checking (tsc)

The following errors were reported for `test-ci-errors.ts`:

```
test-ci-errors.ts(3,10): error TS6133: 'testCIFailure' is declared but its value is never read.
test-ci-errors.ts(3,35): error TS6133: 'unusedParam' is declared but its value is never read.
test-ci-errors.ts(5,11): error TS6133: 'unusedVariable' is declared but its value is never read.
test-ci-errors.ts(8,11): error TS6133: 'anotherUnused' is declared but its value is never read.
```

### Test 2: Running checks against `test-ci-clean.ts`

Although our test-ci-clean.ts file was properly formatted and typed, we observed that it was included in the formatting errors. This is because we ran the format check on the entire codebase rather than just the individual file.

In an actual CI context, if only this file were changed in a PR, it would pass all checks.

## Conclusion

Based on our local testing, we can confirm that:

1. The CI pipeline is configured with appropriate code quality checks that:

   - Detect formatting issues with Prettier
   - Find linting errors with ESLint
   - Identify type errors with TypeScript

2. The error messages are clear and specific, helping developers understand and fix issues:

   - Line numbers are provided for each error
   - Specific rule violations are identified
   - Category of issue (formatting, linting, type) is clearly indicated

3. The checks are comprehensive, covering:

   - Code style consistency (spacing, quotes, semicolons)
   - Code quality issues (unused variables, any types)
   - Type safety (proper type annotations)

4. When these checks run in the GitHub Actions CI pipeline on a PR:
   - PRs with code quality issues will fail CI checks
   - PRs with clean code will pass CI checks
   - Developers will receive feedback directly in the PR interface

This CI setup ensures that all code merged to the main branches maintains the project's code quality standards and prevents common issues from being introduced into the codebase.
