# T011 Plan: Identify Third-Party Components Needing Separate Theming

## Task Description

Investigate if any embedded third-party components lack Tailwind/CSS variable support and require custom theming.

## Task Classification

**Simple** - This is primarily an investigative task that involves examining the codebase to identify third-party components and determine their theming capabilities.

## Implementation Approach

1. Examine package.json to identify all third-party dependencies that might include UI components
2. Search the codebase for imports of third-party components
3. For each identified component, assess:
   - If it uses Tailwind CSS and can inherit theme variables automatically
   - If it uses CSS variables that can be targeted
   - If it requires custom theming or has its own theming system
4. Document the findings, including:
   - Component name and import source
   - Whether it needs custom theming
   - Approach for theming (if needed)

## Implementation Steps

1. Review package.json to list all UI-related dependencies
2. Use grep to search for import statements across the codebase
3. Check the documentation of identified components to understand their theming capabilities
4. Create a comprehensive list documenting each third-party component and its theming requirements
5. Document the findings in a new file: `docs/third-party-components.md`
