# T010 Plan: Audit and Refactor Component Hardcoded Colors

## Task Description

Audit and refactor hardcoded colors in component files to use semantic Tailwind utilities, ensuring consistent color application throughout the application.

## Implementation Approach

1. **Identification Phase**

   - Use grep to search for hardcoded color patterns:
     - Hex colors: `#[0-9a-fA-F]{3,8}`
     - RGB/RGBA colors: `rgb\(|rgba\(`
     - HSL/HSLA colors: `hsl\(|hsla\(`
     - Non-semantic Tailwind colors: `text-red-|bg-blue-|border-green-` etc.
   - Focus on files in `components/**/*.tsx` and `app/**/*.tsx`
   - Create a list of all instances found

2. **Analysis Phase**

   - Determine the semantic meaning of each hardcoded color
   - Match each hardcoded color to the appropriate semantic color token
   - Document any exceptions that shouldn't be refactored with rationale

3. **Refactoring Phase**

   - Replace hardcoded colors with semantic Tailwind utilities:
     - `text-[#hex]` → `text-primary`
     - `bg-red-500` → `bg-destructive`
     - Inline style colors → appropriate Tailwind utility classes
   - Maintain consistent naming conventions with existing codebase

4. **Verification**
   - Verify visual appearance hasn't changed negatively
   - Ensure refactored code follows project conventions

## Expected Results

- All hardcoded colors in component files will be replaced with semantic Tailwind utilities
- Color application will be consistent throughout the application
- Exceptions will be documented with clear rationale
