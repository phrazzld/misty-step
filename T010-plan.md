# T010 Plan: Remove Unused Dependencies

## Task Classification

**Simple** - This is a straightforward task to remove unused dependencies with clear steps.

## Implementation Plan

1. Verify the packages `tw-animate-css` and `lucide-react` are actually in package.json
2. Search the codebase for any import references to these packages
3. If any references are found, remove them
4. Run `pnpm remove tw-animate-css lucide-react` to remove the dependencies
5. Run `pnpm install` to update the lockfile
6. Perform a smoke build to ensure everything still works
7. Verify the packages are absent from package.json and lockfile

## Steps to Execute

1. Check package.json for the dependencies
2. Use grep to find any import references
3. Run the remove command
4. Update the lockfile
5. Perform smoke build
6. Verify success criteria
