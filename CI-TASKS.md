# CI Resolution Tasks

These tasks are derived from the CI failure analysis and resolution plan. They represent the necessary steps to fix the ESLint warning in `components/contact.tsx` that's causing the CI build to fail.

## Tasks

- [ ] [REFACTOR] (HIGH) Extract form validation logic from Contact component

  - Create a Zod schema for the Contact form in a new file (`lib/schemas/contact-form-schema.ts`)
  - Define appropriate validation rules for each field (name, email, message)
  - Ensure the schema exports a proper TypeScript type for the form data
  - Verification: File exists with correct validation schema

- [ ] [REFACTOR] (HIGH) Integrate Zod validation in Contact component

  - Import the Zod schema and zodResolver into Contact component
  - Update the useForm hook to use the Zod resolver
  - Remove inline validation logic (registerOptions prop) from FormField components
  - Verification: Component passes typecheck with no errors

- [ ] [REFACTOR] (HIGH) Reduce Contact component line count

  - Refactor the component to be less than 75 lines total
  - Consider extracting more subcomponents or simplifying existing logic
  - Verification: Component is below 75 lines and passes ESLint checks

- [ ] [TEST] (MEDIUM) Update tests for refactored Contact component

  - Modify any tests that rely on the previous validation approach
  - Ensure tests cover the new Zod validation schema behavior
  - Verification: All tests pass with no warnings

- [ ] [VERIFY] (HIGH) Run all verification steps
  - Run `pnpm format:check` to verify formatting
  - Run `pnpm lint` to verify linting passes with no warnings
  - Run `pnpm typecheck` to verify type checking passes
  - Run `pnpm test` to verify all tests pass
  - Verification: All checks pass with no errors or warnings

## After Completing Tasks

After completing these tasks, the CI build should pass successfully. The Contact component will be more maintainable, with cleaner separation of concerns following the project's development philosophy.

## Prevention Measures

To prevent similar issues in the future:

- Always run `pnpm lint` locally before committing
- Be mindful of component sizes and refactor when approaching line limits
- Consider adding a pre-commit hook that verifies line counts for components
- Remind team members about the importance of adhering to linting rules
