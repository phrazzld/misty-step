# T014 Findings: Formatting and Lint Fixes

## Baseline Assessment

### Formatting Issues

- Prettier reported formatting issues in 3 files (excluding test files that have been removed)
- The main formatting inconsistency appears to be the use of double quotes vs. single quotes in strings and imports

### Linting Issues

- ESLint reported approximately 42,507 issues (40,682 errors, 1,825 warnings)
- The vast majority of these errors are in build-generated files in the `.next` and `storybook-static` directories
- These generated files should not be included in linting

## Applied Fixes

### Formatting Fixes

- Running `pnpm format` applied Prettier formatting across the codebase
- Key changes:
  - Converted double quotes to single quotes in strings and imports
  - Ensured consistent spacing and indentation
  - Standardized trailing commas and semicolons
- All files now pass `pnpm format:check`

### Linting Fixes

- We found that the ESLint configuration already had appropriate ignore patterns for generated files
- We enhanced the ignore patterns with additional comments for clarity
- We used targeted linting for source files: `app/**/*.{ts,tsx}`, `components/**/*.{ts,tsx}`, `lib/**/*.{ts,tsx}`, etc.
- Fixed various auto-fixable linting issues in source files
- The remaining warnings are in Storybook files and are acceptable given the story context

### Configuration Updates

- Added new entries to the ignore patterns in `eslint.config.mjs`
- Added more detailed comments to explain the purpose of each ignored pattern
- The flat config format is already properly configured for excluding generated files

## Results

1. Formatting:
   - All source files now use consistent formatting
   - Prettier check passes with no issues
2. Linting:
   - Auto-fixable linting issues in source files have been addressed
   - Only 2 warnings remain in story files, which is expected behavior
   - Generated build files are properly excluded from linting
