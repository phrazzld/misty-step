# Glance: Automated Documentation Generation Tool

## Overview

The `glance` command is an automated documentation generation tool that creates `glance.md` files throughout a codebase. These files contain technical overviews of directories, explaining their purpose, architecture, key file roles, and important dependencies.

## Purpose in Post-Commit Hook

The `.husky/post-commit` hook runs `glance ./` asynchronously after each commit, generating or updating the `glance.md` documentation files across the project. This ensures that directory documentation stays up-to-date with the latest changes to the codebase.

### Implementation Details

The hook currently:

1. Runs `glance ./` asynchronously to avoid blocking the commit process
2. Redirects output to `/tmp/glance-post-commit.log` to avoid cluttering the terminal
3. Displays a message indicating the background process has started

## Benefits

- **Self-Documenting Codebase**: Creates and maintains automated directory-level documentation
- **Onboarding Assistance**: Helps new developers understand the codebase structure and purpose
- **Technical Overview**: Provides insight into architectural patterns used in different directories
- **Low Developer Overhead**: Runs automatically without requiring manual action

## Potential Issues

- **Dependency**: Requires the `glance` command to be installed globally
- **Temporary Log File**: Uses `/tmp` for storing logs, which may be cleared on system reboot
- **Non-Critical Process**: If `glance` fails, it does not affect the commit itself, but may result in outdated documentation

## Recommendation

**Keep the hook with improvements**: The `glance` command provides valuable automated documentation with minimal overhead. However, the hook implementation should be improved for better reliability and security:

1. The log file should be moved to `.logs/husky/glance-post-commit.log` within the project directory
2. Better error handling should be added to handle cases where `glance` is not installed
3. File permissions for log files should be set appropriately

## Failure Modes and Mitigations

| Failure Mode               | Impact                      | Mitigation                                                   |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `glance` not installed     | Documentation not generated | Add check for presence of `glance` with helpful message      |
| Log directory not writable | Log output lost             | Create directory with proper permissions if it doesn't exist |
| `glance` execution fails   | Documentation not updated   | Add error capture and reporting                              |

## Usage Outside of Git Hooks

The `glance` command can also be run manually to generate or update documentation:

```bash
glance ./
```

This will scan all directories in the project and generate/update `glance.md` files that provide technical overviews of each directory.

## Relationship with Other Tools

The `glance` command appears to be part of a broader toolchain, with references in other projects like "codex" where it's used for similar documentation purposes. It is often referenced alongside the `thinktank-wrapper` tool, which has an option to `--include-glance` files in its analysis.

## Conclusion

The `glance` command and associated post-commit hook provide valuable automated documentation with minimal developer overhead. With the recommended improvements to logging and error handling, it should be retained as part of the development workflow.
