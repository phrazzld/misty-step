# Color Contrast Verification Results

This document contains the results of contrast verification for the Misty Step marketing website color palette. All color pairs have been tested against WCAG 2.1 AA requirements:

- Normal text: 4.5:1 minimum contrast ratio
- Large text and UI components: 3:1 minimum contrast ratio

## Verification Method

Colors were converted from Oklch to RGB using standard conversion algorithms, and contrast ratios were calculated using the WCAG formula:

```
(L1 + 0.05) / (L2 + 0.05)
```

where L1 is the relative luminance of the lighter color and L2 is the relative luminance of the darker color.

## Recommended Adjustments

Based on the verification results, the following color pairs need adjustments to meet WCAG 2.1 AA requirements:

### Light Mode Adjustments

1. **primary-foreground/primary (3.03)**:

   - Increase lightness of primary-foreground OR decrease lightness of primary
   - Suggested: Adjust primary to `oklch(0.48 0.28 265)` for better contrast

2. **accent-foreground/accent (1.52)**:

   - Significant change needed
   - Suggested: Adjust accent to `oklch(0.65 0.15 290)` for better contrast

3. **destructive-foreground/destructive (2.48)**:

   - Increase lightness of destructive-foreground OR decrease lightness of destructive
   - Suggested: Adjust destructive to `oklch(0.55 0.28 25)` for better contrast

4. **sidebar-primary-foreground/sidebar-primary (3.03)**:
   - Same issue as primary, use the same adjustment

### Dark Mode Adjustments

1. **primary-foreground/primary (1.81)**:

   - Significant change needed
   - Suggested: Adjust primary to `oklch(0.5 0.25 265)` for better contrast

2. **accent-foreground/accent (3.52)**:

   - Minor adjustment needed for normal text
   - Suggested: Adjust accent to `oklch(0.4 0.15 290)` for better contrast

3. **destructive-foreground/destructive (1.71)**:

   - Significant change needed
   - Suggested: Adjust destructive to `oklch(0.55 0.22 25)` for better contrast

4. **sidebar-primary-foreground/sidebar-primary (1.81)**:
   - Same issue as primary, use the same adjustment

## Conclusion

Several color pairs in both light and dark modes do not meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements. The recommendations above should be implemented to ensure accessibility compliance while maintaining the visual design intent.

After making these adjustments, another round of verification should be performed to ensure all pairs meet the requirements.
