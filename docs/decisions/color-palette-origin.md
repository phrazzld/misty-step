# Color Palette Origin Decision

## Date

2025-04-28

## Context

As part of implementing a more distinct and vibrant color scheme for the Misty Step marketing website, we need to clarify who is responsible for defining the specific HSL/Oklch color values for the new brand color palette.

## Decision

The Development team will propose the color palette based on the "distinct and vibrant" requirements since:

1. This is a small project without a dedicated Design team
2. The development team has expertise in color theory and accessibility requirements
3. The proposed values will go through a rigorous validation process to ensure they meet WCAG AA standards

## Process

The following process will be followed:

1. **Development Team** will:

   - Propose initial HSL/Oklch values for all semantic color roles in both light and dark modes
   - Use tools like WebAIM Contrast Checker to validate accessibility compliance
   - Create color scales that provide adequate contrast for text and UI elements
   - Document the proposed values

2. **Stakeholder Review** (Product Owner/Client):

   - Review the proposed color palette on the staging site
   - Provide feedback on visual appeal and brand alignment
   - Approve final color values

3. **Final Implementation**:
   - Document final values in code and in documentation
   - Implement across the application
   - Validate with automated contrast checking tools

## Responsibilities

| Role                 | Responsibility                                                             |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Development          | Propose initial values, ensure accessibility compliance, implement in code |
| Product Owner/Client | Provide feedback on visual appeal and brand alignment                      |
| QA                   | Verify accessibility standards are met                                     |

This decision means that T003 (propose initial color palette values) remains with the Development team.
