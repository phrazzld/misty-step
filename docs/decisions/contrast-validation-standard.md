# Contrast Validation Standard and Tool Decision

## Date

2025-04-28

## Context

As part of implementing a more distinct and vibrant color scheme for the Misty Step marketing website, we need to specify which accessibility standard and tools will be used to validate contrast ratios in our new color palette.

## Decision

The project will adhere to **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** standards for all contrast requirements. We've chosen this standard because:

1. It's widely recognized as the industry baseline for accessibility compliance
2. It provides clear, measurable contrast requirements
3. It's supported by a wide range of validation tools
4. It satisfies most legal accessibility requirements

## Contrast Requirements (WCAG 2.1 AA)

| Element Type                              | Minimum Contrast Ratio |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Normal text (less than 18pt or 14pt bold) | 4.5:1                  |
| Large text (at least 18pt or 14pt bold)   | 3:1                    |
| UI components and graphical objects       | 3:1                    |

## Validation Tools

The following tools will be used for contrast validation throughout the implementation:

1. **Primary Tool: [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)**

   - Will be used during initial color selection (T003)
   - Provides precise contrast ratio measurements
   - Allows testing of both light and dark mode colors

2. **Development Workflow: Chrome DevTools Color Picker**

   - Built into browser, convenient for rapid iteration
   - Shows contrast ratio in real-time as colors are adjusted
   - Indicates pass/fail for AA compliance

3. **Automated Testing: Axe Browser Extension**
   - Will be used for final validation (T017)
   - Provides comprehensive accessibility audits
   - Can scan entire pages for contrast issues

## Process Integration

The contrast validation process will be integrated into these specific tasks:

1. **T003 (Propose initial color palette values)**

   - Use WebAIM Contrast Checker to verify all initial color pairs

2. **T004 (Verify and iterate on palette accessibility)**

   - Use WebAIM Contrast Checker and Chrome DevTools to iterate on colors until all pass
   - Document any exceptions where full compliance isn't possible due to brand requirements

3. **T017 (Run automated accessibility contrast checks)**
   - Use Axe to perform automated checks on the implemented color scheme
   - Document and resolve any reported issues

## Responsibilities

| Role        | Responsibility                                                       |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Development | Ensure all proposed color combinations meet WCAG 2.1 AA requirements |
| QA          | Verify contrast compliance using the specified tools                 |

This decision means that T004 (verify and iterate on palette accessibility) and T017 (run automated accessibility contrast checks) will use these standards and tools.
