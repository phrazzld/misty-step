# T009 Plan: Implement Structured Logging Solution

## Analysis

This task requires implementing a structured logging solution using Pino, a popular JSON logger for Node.js. We need to:

1. Install the Pino package
2. Create a logger configuration file at `lib/logger.ts`
3. Find and replace all `console.log` and `console.error` calls with the structured logger equivalents

## Approach

This is a "Simple" task as it involves:

- Installing a package
- Creating a single new file
- Making targeted replacements in existing files
- Clear well-defined scope (replacing console logging with structured logging)

## Implementation Steps

1. Install Pino as a dependency
2. Create `lib/logger.ts` that exports a configured logger instance
3. Search for all instances of `console.log` and `console.error` in the codebase
4. Replace them with appropriate `logger.info` and `logger.error` calls
5. Add types for the logger
6. Test the logging implementation
7. Update TODO.md to mark the task as complete
8. Commit the changes

## Success Criteria

- Pino is installed and configured
- All console logging is replaced with structured logging
- Logger includes proper metadata (timestamp, level, service_name)
- No `console.log` or `console.error` calls remain in the codebase
