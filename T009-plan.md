# T009 Plan: Verify tailwind.config.mjs color mapping

## Task Description

Review `tailwind.config.mjs` `theme.extend.colors` section and confirm all semantic keys map to CSS variables via `hsl(var(--variable-name))` syntax, including `foreground` variants.

## Task Classification

**Simple** - This task involves a single file review and verification with no implementation changes needed unless issues are found.

## Implementation Approach

1. Review all color mappings in the `theme.extend.colors` section of `tailwind.config.mjs`
2. Compare these mappings against the CSS variables defined in `globals.css`
3. Verify that:
   - All color variables from `globals.css` have corresponding mappings in the Tailwind config
   - All mappings use the correct `hsl(var(--variable-name))` syntax
   - All color variants (such as foreground variants) are properly mapped
4. Document findings and needed changes (if any)

## Implementation Steps

1. Examine the `colors` object in `tailwind.config.mjs`
2. Check if all semantic color tokens are mapped correctly
3. Verify all foreground variants are included
4. Compare with our newly implemented color variables to ensure full coverage
5. If all mappings are correct, document confirmation
6. If issues are found, document and plan necessary changes
