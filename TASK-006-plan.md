# TASK-006: Create Placeholder Verification Story - Plan

## Task Classification

Medium - This task involves creating a new Storybook story file that demonstrates all the configured features.

## Approach

1. Check if the required static asset exists in the public directory
2. Create the stories directory if it doesn't exist
3. Create a new story file that imports a UI component using the @/ alias
4. Implement the story with the required features: Tailwind classes, global styles, component import, static asset

## Implementation Steps

1. Verify that vercel.svg or another suitable static asset exists in the public directory
2. Create the stories directory if it doesn't exist
3. Create the SetupVerification.stories.tsx file
4. Implement the story according to the requirements:
   - Import React, Meta, StoryObj
   - Import a UI component using the @/ alias (Button is a good candidate)
   - Create a story that demonstrates:
     - Tailwind utility classes
     - Global styles/CSS variables
     - The imported component
     - An image loading from the static directory
   - Define Meta with the correct title

## Verification of Success
