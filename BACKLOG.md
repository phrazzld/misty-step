# BACKLOG

This backlog outlines the planned work for the Misty Step website, balancing immediate feature needs, brand development, technical excellence, and long-term strategic goals.

## High Priority

### Brand Identity & Content Strategy

- **[Ops]**: Set up Storybook and initial component library

- **[Feature]**: Define and Document Core Brand Identity & Messaging

  - **Complexity**: Medium
  - **Rationale**: Establishes the foundational voice, tone, visual direction ("personality", "purpose") crucial for consistent communication and design implementation. Ensures the site clearly communicates the company's value proposition.
  - **Expected Outcome**: A concise brand guideline document (or section in README/docs) covering mission, voice, tone, target audience, and core messaging points. Website copy reflects this identity.
  - **Dependencies**: Influences UI/UX Design, Copywriting.

- **[Enhancement]**: Refine Website Copy for Clarity and Impact
  - **Complexity**: Medium
  - **Rationale**: Ensures key pages (Homepage, About, Services if applicable) clearly articulate the company's purpose and value proposition, directly addressing the need to "clarify purpose".
  - **Expected Outcome**: Compelling, concise, and brand-aligned copy on all primary website pages. Improved user understanding of Misty Step's offerings.
  - **Dependencies**: Depends on "Define and Document Core Brand Identity & Messaging".

### Core Functionality & User Experience

- **[Feature]**: Implement Functional Contact Form Submission

  - **Complexity**: Medium
  - **Rationale**: Enables lead generation and user communication, a fundamental requirement ("unstub contact form"). Currently a blocker for user interaction and business value.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Users can submit the contact form, and submissions are reliably received at hello@mistystep.io (or via a backend service/integration like Netlify Forms or SendGrid). Clear success/failure feedback is shown to the user.
  - **Dependencies**: Decision on backend implementation/integration.

- **[Enhancement]**: Establish Foundational Design System (Colors, Typography, Spacing)

  - **Complexity**: Medium
  - **Rationale**: Creates a consistent visual language ("high design vibes") necessary for implementing specific aesthetic goals and ensuring maintainability. Addresses the "personality" aspect at a structural level.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Defined color palette, typographic scale, and spacing rules implemented consistently across the site using CSS variables or a theming system. Provides the basis for component styling.
  - **Dependencies**: Influenced by "Define and Document Core Brand Identity & Messaging".

- **[Fix]**: Ensure Core Responsiveness Across Devices
  - **Complexity**: Medium
  - **Rationale**: Guarantees a usable and professional experience for users on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Essential for modern web presence and accessibility.
  - **Expected Outcome**: All primary pages render correctly and are easily navigable on common screen sizes (e.g., 320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px+). No layout breakage or usability issues. Verified via browser developer tools and potentially real devices.

### Performance & SEO Foundations

- **[Enhancement]**: Implement Basic SEO Metadata & Structure

  - **Complexity**: Simple
  - **Rationale**: Ensures the site is discoverable by search engines, improving organic traffic and visibility. Critical for a marketing site.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Pages have appropriate meta titles, descriptions, and semantic HTML structure (headings, landmarks). Generation and configuration of `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml`. Basic Open Graph tags for social sharing.
  - **Dependencies**: Requires finalized page titles and descriptions from content refinement.

- **[Enhancement]**: Conduct Initial Performance Audit & Basic Optimizations
  - **Complexity**: Medium
  - **Rationale**: Establishes a performance baseline and addresses low-hanging fruit to improve initial load times and user experience, impacting retention and SEO.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Baseline Lighthouse performance score recorded. Obvious bottlenecks (e.g., unoptimized images, render-blocking resources) identified and addressed. Target initial improvement in Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID/INP, CLS).
  - **Dependencies**: None.

## Medium Priority

### User Experience & Design Enhancements

- **[Enhancement]**: Implement Subtle & Elegant UI Animations

  - **Complexity**: Medium
  - **Rationale**: Adds polish and delight ("elegant subtle delightful animations"), enhancing the user experience and reinforcing the desired "high design vibes" aesthetic without hindering performance.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Smooth, non-intrusive animations on key interactions (e.g., button hover, page transitions, element loading/scroll reveal) implemented consistently. Animations demonstrably improve UX rather than hindering it (verified via user feedback or usability testing if possible).
  - **Dependencies**: Requires stable foundational UI components and Design System.

- **[Enhancement]**: Refine Component Styling for Visual Appeal & Consistency
  - **Complexity**: Medium
  - **Rationale**: Improves the overall look and feel ("aesthetics"), aligning individual components with the defined brand identity and design system.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Key UI components (buttons, cards, navigation, forms) have polished styling consistent with the brand aesthetic and design system. Improved visual hierarchy and appeal across the site.
  - **Dependencies**: Depends on "Establish Foundational Design System".

### Content & Communication

- **[Feature]**: Develop an “About” or “Philosophy” Page
  - **Complexity**: Medium
  - **Rationale**: Builds credibility and allows for deeper storytelling, providing context beyond the homepage. Helps articulate company values and mission.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Informative and engaging page elaborating on company values, mission, vision, and potentially the team. Content aligned with brand identity.
  - **Dependencies**: Depends on "Define and Document Core Brand Identity & Messaging".

### Technical Excellence & Accessibility

- **[Refactor]**: Review and Refactor Core UI Components for Reusability & Maintainability
  - **Complexity**: Medium
  - **Rationale**: Improves code maintainability, consistency, and developer experience by ensuring components are well-structured (DRY principle), testable, and reusable. Reduces technical debt.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Key UI elements (e.g., buttons, inputs, layout containers) are implemented as reusable components with clear props and separation of concerns. Reduced code duplication. Potential setup of a tool like Storybook for component visualization.
- **[Enhancement]**: Conduct Accessibility Audit & Remediation (Target WCAG 2.1 AA)
  - **Complexity**: Medium
  - **Rationale**: Ensures the website is usable by people with disabilities, broadening the potential audience, improving SEO, and complying with best practices/legal requirements.
