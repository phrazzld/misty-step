  - **Complexity**: Medium
  - **Rationale**: Creates a consistent visual language ("high design vibes") necessary for implementing specific aesthetic goals and ensuring maintainability. Aligns with Frontend Appendix (Tailwind theme config) and Core Philosophy (Modularity).
  - **Expected Outcome**: Defined color palette, typographic scale, and spacing rules implemented via Tailwind CSS theme configuration (`tailwind.config.js`) or CSS variables. Base styles applied globally.
  - **Dependencies**: Define and Document Core Brand Identity & Messaging.

### Core User Experience & Functionality

- **[Feature]**: Implement Functional Contact Form Submission (Client-Side Logic & UI)

  - **Type**: Feature
  - **Complexity**: Medium
  - **Rationale**: Enables lead generation and user communication, a fundamental business requirement ("unstub contact form"). This covers the frontend aspects.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Users can fill out the contact form. Client-side validation (e.g., using React Hook Form + Zod) implemented. Clear success/failure UI feedback provided based on submission attempt.
  - **Dependencies**: Foundational Design System.

- **[Feature]**: Implement Robust Server-Side Validation & Processing for Contact Form

  - **Type**: Feature
  - **Complexity**: Medium
  - **Rationale**: Ensures data integrity and security for the primary user interaction point. Aligns with Core Philosophy (Security - "NEVER trust external input"). Critical for reliable lead capture.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Backend mechanism (e.g., serverless function) rigorously validates all inputs for type, format, length, and potential malicious content before processing. Submissions are reliably received (e.g., sent via email, stored). Basic spam protection considered.
  - **Dependencies**: Implement Functional Contact Form Submission (Client-Side Logic & UI).

- **[Enhancement]**: Refine Website Copy for Clarity and Impact (Homepage, Key Sections)

  - **Type**: Enhancement
  - **Complexity**: Medium
  - **Rationale**: Ensures key pages clearly articulate the company's purpose and value proposition, directly addressing the need to "clarify purpose" and improve user engagement. Aligns with Core Philosophy (Document the Why).
  - **Expected Outcome**: Compelling, concise, and brand-aligned copy on the Homepage and other primary sections. Improved user understanding of Misty Step's offerings.
  - **Dependencies**: Define and Document Core Brand Identity & Messaging.

- **[Fix]**: Ensure Core Responsiveness Across Devices (Mobile-First)
  - **Type**: Fix

  - **Rationale**: Guarantees a usable and professional experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop. Mandatory per Frontend Appendix (Mobile-First). Essential for modern web presence, accessibility, and user satisfaction.
  - **Expected Outcome**: All primary pages render correctly and are easily navigable on standard breakpoints (e.g., 320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px+). No layout breakage or usability issues. Verified via browser dev tools.
  - **Dependencies**: Foundational Design System.

### Initial Technical Excellence & Developer Experience

- **[Ops]**: Set up Storybook for Component Development & Documentation

  - **Type**: Enhancement
  - **Complexity**: Medium
  - **Rationale**: Mandated by Frontend Appendix (Storybook-First). Enforces component-driven development, provides a living style guide, facilitates isolated development/testing. Improves developer experience and maintainability.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Storybook installed and configured. Basic structure set up reflecting Atomic Design levels. Example stories for initial UI primitives created. Storybook build integrated into CI.
  - **Dependencies**: Foundational Design System.

- **[Enhancement]**: Implement Basic SEO Metadata & Structure

  - **Type**: Enhancement
  - **Complexity**: Simple

  - **Dependencies**: Implement Robust Server-Side Validation & Processing for Contact Form (for logging context).

## Medium Priority

### Code Review Issues

- **[Fix]**: Add Storybook ESLint Plugin Configuration

  - **Type**: Fix
  - **Complexity**: Simple
  - **Rationale**: Storybook-specific linting rules are not being applied because the configuration was removed from `package.json`'s `eslintConfig` block but not re-integrated into the new `eslint.config.mjs` flat config. This means potential issues specific to Storybook best practices might be missed.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Storybook ESLint plugin properly integrated into `eslint.config.mjs` for `*.stories.*` files, ensuring consistent code quality for Storybook components.
  - **Dependencies**: None.

- **[Fix]**: Improve Error Handling in Contact Form Submission

  - **Type**: Fix
  - **Complexity**: Simple
  - **Rationale**: The `catch {}` block in `handleFormSubmit` discards the actual error object, making debugging unexpected failures in the form submission process extremely difficult, as all specific error details are lost.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Error handling improved by capturing and properly logging the error object using the project's structured logger. Sensitive information not exposed in user-facing messages but available in developer logs.
  - **Dependencies**: Implement Basic Structured Logging Setup.

- **[Refactor]**: Extract Complex Inline Script from lint-staged Configuration

  - **Type**: Refactor
  - **Complexity**: Simple
  - **Rationale**: The inline Node.js script for filtering out symlinks in markdown formatting is difficult to read, maintain, and debug directly within the JSON configuration file, making the lint-staged configuration more fragile.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Node.js logic extracted into a dedicated script file with proper documentation, called from the `.lintstagedrc.json` rule for `*.md` files.
  - **Dependencies**: None.

- **[Ops]**: Remove Temporary Test/Verification File

  - **Type**: Ops
  - **Complexity**: Simple
  - **Rationale**: Committing temporary files used for manual verification clutters the repository history unnecessarily. The verification steps are already documented in `TODO.md`.
  - **Expected Outcome**: `test-commit-msg.txt` removed from the repository.
  - **Dependencies**: None.

- **[Refactor]**: Evaluate FormField Component Abstraction

  - **Type**: Refactor
  - **Complexity**: Simple
  - **Rationale**: The `FormField` component uses an `isTextarea` boolean prop, which could become awkward if more field types are introduced. For only three fields of two types, the abstraction benefit is marginal.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Evaluation of the current abstraction with recommendations for either maintaining it or creating more specialized field components if additional form types are needed.
  - **Dependencies**: None.

- **[Refactor]**: Simplify ESLint Scripts in package.json

  - **Type**: Refactor
  - **Complexity**: Simple
  - **Rationale**: The explicit listing of all directories in the `lint` and `lint:fix` scripts is verbose and requires manual updates if new top-level source directories are added.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Scripts simplified to use the current directory (`.`) with proper `ignorePatterns` in `eslint.config.mjs`.
  - **Dependencies**: None.

- **[Refactor]**: Review ESLint no-param-reassign Rule Exception

  - **Type**: Refactor
  - **Complexity**: Simple
  - **Rationale**: Allowing direct mutation of parameters named "state" is a broad exception that could inadvertently permit direct state mutation in contexts where it's an anti-pattern.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Exception made more specific by restricting it to files matching appropriate patterns, or documented explanation of why the broad exception is necessary.
  - **Dependencies**: None.

  - **Dependencies**: Implement Atomic Design Component Structure.

- **[Enhancement]**: Integrate Zod Schema Validation for Forms (with React Hook Form)
  - **Type**: Enhancement
  - **Complexity**: Medium
  - **Rationale**: Mandated by Frontend Appendix (Form Handling - "Zod for schema validation with React Hook Form") for robust, type-safe form validation, providing a single source of truth.
