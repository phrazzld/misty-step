## Task Classification

**Simple** - This task involves finding and replacing all npm command references with pnpm equivalents in markdown documentation files. It's a straightforward search and replace task.

## Implementation Plan

2. Search for npm command references in these files
3. Replace all npm commands with their pnpm equivalents
4. Verify no npm references remain in the documentation

## Steps to Execute

1. Use GlobTool to find all .md files
2. Use GrepTool to identify files containing npm references
3. Update each occurrence to use pnpm instead
4. Verify all occurrences have been replaced
