This is a test file to verify the commit-msg hook.

Verification Results (Task T008):
- Husky commit-msg hook is properly configured to use pnpm commitlint
- Commitlint is configured to use @commitlint/config-conventional
- Tests confirm that:
  - Invalid commit messages (not following Conventional Commits) are rejected
  - Valid commit messages following the Conventional Commits format are accepted
  - Valid scoped commit messages (e.g., "fix(component): message") are accepted

The commit-msg hook is correctly enforcing Conventional Commits standards as required.
