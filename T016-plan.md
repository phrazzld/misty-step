# T016 - Document rationale for strict linting and formatting rules

## Task Description
- **ID and Title**: T016 · Chore · P3: Document rationale for strict linting and formatting rules
- **Context**: Help developers understand why strict rules are enforced
- **Action**:
  1. Add a section to the project's development guidelines or `README.md`
  2. Explain the benefits of enforcing strict linting and formatting rules (e.g., code consistency, early bug detection, maintainability)
  3. Include links or references to how auto-fixes can be applied
- **Done-when**:
  1. The rationale for strict rules is clearly documented and accessible to developers
- **Depends-on**: [T015]

## Analysis & Implementation Plan

### Current Status
After reviewing the existing documentation:

1. The README.md already has a "Code Quality" section that:
   - Lists the code quality tools used (TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, etc.)
   - Describes key ESLint rules
   - Explains the pre-commit workflow
   
2. The newly created CONTRIBUTING.md includes:
   - Detailed setup instructions for the development environment
   - Explanation of the pre-commit workflow
   - Troubleshooting information for code quality tools

3. What's missing is:
   - Clear explanation of the **rationale** behind enforcing strict rules
   - Discussion of the benefits of strict linting and formatting
   - Information about how to apply auto-fixes

### Implementation Strategy
Rather than duplicating information already in the README.md or CONTRIBUTING.md, I'll:

1. Add a new section to the docs/CONTRIBUTING.md file titled "Code Quality Philosophy" that:
   - Explains the rationale for strict linting and formatting rules
   - Discusses the benefits in terms of code quality, maintainability, and team productivity
   - References specific examples of how the rules help prevent common issues

2. Include information about auto-fixing tools and when to use them

3. Keep the content focused on the "why" rather than the "how", since the "how" is already well-documented.

### Document Outline
The new section will cover:

1. **Code Quality Philosophy** - Introduction to the approach
2. **Benefits of Strict Linting and Formatting**
   - Consistency across the codebase
   - Early detection of potential bugs
   - Improved maintainability
   - Increased team productivity
   - Better onboarding for new developers
3. **Auto-Fixing and Manual Resolution** - When and how to use auto-fixes

## Implementation Plan
1. Update docs/CONTRIBUTING.md with the new "Code Quality Philosophy" section
2. Ensure the content is comprehensive and convincing
3. Reference relevant tools and commands for auto-fixing issues
