# PLAN-INDEX: Storybook Setup & Component Library

The implementation of Storybook and initial component library for the Misty Step marketing website has been split into two separate plans to ensure manageable scope, focused reviews, and iterative value delivery.

## Available Plans:

1. **[PLAN-1.md](./PLAN-1.md): Storybook Core Setup & Integration**

   - Installs and configures Storybook with necessary addons (Vite, React, Tailwind, themes)
   - Sets up proper styling, theming, and path alias support
   - Adds npm scripts and CI integration
   - Creates a minimal placeholder story for verification
   - Provides usage documentation

2. **[PLAN-2.md](./PLAN-2.md): Initial UI Component Story Creation**
   - Creates comprehensive stories for core Shadcn UI components (`Button`, `Card`, `Input`, `Label`, `Textarea`)
   - Utilizes interactive controls and showcases all component variations
   - Ensures proper theme support (light/dark) for all stories
   - Adds documentation on creating new stories

## Dependencies

- PLAN-1 must be implemented first, as it establishes the Storybook platform
- PLAN-2 requires the successful completion and merge of PLAN-1

## Original Plan

The original, unmodified plan can be found in [PLAN-ORIGINAL.md](./PLAN-ORIGINAL.md) for reference.
