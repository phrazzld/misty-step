/**
 * STORYBOOK CSS STYLING ARCHITECTURE
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: This file does NOT contain Tailwind directives or classes.
 * 
 * Tailwind CSS is imported through the following architecture:
 * 1. The main Tailwind directives (@import "tailwindcss", @layer, etc.) are defined in '../app/globals.css'
 * 2. That file is imported in 'preview.tsx' alongside this CSS file
 * 3. This separation ensures that:
 *    - Storybook components receive the same Tailwind styling as the main application
 *    - Changes to the app's design system are automatically reflected in Storybook
 *    - Storybook-specific styling (below) stays separate from the app's styling concerns
 * 
 * This file contains ONLY Storybook-specific styling overrides that aren't 
 * part of the main application styling.
