# T005 Plan: Document Finalized Color Values

## Task Classification

This is a **Simple** task that involves creating documentation based on existing information. It requires extracting and organizing the finalized color values from the previously completed verification work into a format that's easy to reference for implementation.

## Approach

1. Extract the finalized color values from `docs/design-system/ADJUSTED-COLOR.md`, which already contains the verified colors that pass WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements
2. Format these values into a clear, concise document that's easy to reference for implementation
3. Place the document at a standard location in the project's documentation structure
4. Ensure the document includes all necessary semantic color tokens for both light and dark modes

## Implementation Details

1. Create a new document at `docs/colors.md` that:

   - Summarizes the color palette purpose and accessibility compliance
   - Lists all semantic color tokens with their Oklch values for light mode
   - Lists all semantic color tokens with their Oklch values for dark mode
   - Includes notes on usage guidelines for implementing the colors

2. Structure the document to be focused on implementation, keeping detailed verification information and adjustment history in their respective existing files

## Resource Needs

- No external resources needed
- All necessary information already exists in `docs/design-system/ADJUSTED-COLOR.md`

## Risks and Mitigations

- Risk: Missing some color tokens that will be needed for implementation
  - Mitigation: Cross-check with shadcn UI documentation to ensure all expected tokens are included
- Risk: Confusion between verification documentation and implementation documentation
  - Mitigation: Clearly state the purpose of each document
