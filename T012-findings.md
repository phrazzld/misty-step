# T012 Findings: Pre-commit Hook End-to-End Test

## Overview

This document summarizes the findings from testing the pre-commit hook implementation to ensure it correctly handles different code quality scenarios.

## Test Cases

### 1. Files with Auto-fixable Formatting and Linting Errors

- **Test File**: `test-autofix.ts`
- **Content**: Code with formatting issues (spacing, semicolons, etc.) and lint errors
- **Result**: The pre-commit hook ran but could not proceed due to unfixable lint errors (unused variables)
- **Verification**: Commit was rejected with clear error messages indicating the issues

### 2. Files with Non-auto-fixable Linting Errors

- **Test File**: `test-non-fixable.ts`
- **Content**: Code with TypeScript/ESLint violations that cannot be auto-fixed (e.g., `any` type, unused variables)
- **Result**: The pre-commit hook correctly blocked the commit
- **Verification**: Commit was rejected with appropriate error messages

### 3. Clean Files

- **Test File**: `test-clean.ts`
- **Content**: Well-formatted code that complies with all linting rules
- **Result**: The pre-commit hook ran successfully and allowed the commit to proceed
- **Verification**: Commit succeeded without errors

## Conclusion

The pre-commit hook is working as expected:

1. It correctly identifies and reports linting errors
2. It prevents commits when there are unfixable issues
3. It allows clean code to be committed
4. The performance is reasonable for the test cases

## Additional Notes

- The hook ran `prettier --write` before `eslint --fix` as configured in `.lintstagedrc.json`
- Error messages were clear and properly formatted for developers to understand
- The hook properly rolled back when errors were detected
