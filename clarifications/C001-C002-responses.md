### C002: Recommended Icon Usage and Format

**1. Should we use icons for the service cards?**

**Recommendation:** **Yes.**

**Rationale:**

- **Improved Scannability:** Icons help users quickly grasp the essence of each service and differentiate between cards visually.
- **Enhanced Visual Appeal:** They break up text, add visual interest, and contribute to a more engaging user interface.
- **Modern UI Pattern:** Using icons in card headers is a common and effective practice in contemporary web design.
- **Brand Reinforcement:** Consistent, professional icons can subtly reinforce Misty Step's technological focus and brand identity.

**2. If yes, what format is recommended?**

**Recommendation:** **Lucide React icon components (`lucide-react`)**

**Rationale:**

- **Ecosystem Compatibility:** `lucide-react` integrates seamlessly with React, Next.js, TypeScript, and is commonly used alongside UI component libraries like Shadcn UI and styling solutions like Tailwind CSS.
- **Developer Experience (DX):** Importing and using icons as typed React components (`<IconName />`) is straightforward and aligns well with a component-based architecture.
- **Performance:** The library is tree-shakable, ensuring only the icons actually imported are included in the final application bundle, minimizing performance impact.
- **Consistency & Style:** Lucide provides a large, high-quality set of icons with a consistent, clean, stroke-based aesthetic suitable for a professional technology firm.
- **Styling Flexibility:** Icons can be easily styled (size, color, stroke width) using standard React props or Tailwind utility classes (e.g., `<ServerIcon className="w-6 h-6 text-primary" />`).

**Alternative:**

- **SVG Imports as React Components:** Directly importing SVG files and using a tool like SVGR (often integrated into frameworks like Next.js) is also a strong option, especially if you require highly custom icons or wish to avoid an external dependency. However, for a standard set, Lucide offers greater convenience and guaranteed consistency.

**Avoid:**

- **Emoji Strings:** Emojis render inconsistently across different operating systems and browsers, can look unprofessional, and may present accessibility challenges.
